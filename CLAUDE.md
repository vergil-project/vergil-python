# vergil-python

The repo builds one runtime package per listed series. The pins
(`runtime.toml` `[[series]]` and `vergil.toml` `[[package]]`) are moved by the
upstream-refresh hook `scripts/dev/upstream-refresh.sh`, which
`vrg-upstream-refresh` runs.

- Every `runtime.toml` series must have exactly one matching `vergil.toml`
  `[[package]]` entry; `packaging/build.sh` fails the build if they disagree.
- The hook rewrites `runtime.toml` whole, header included: it writes
  `RUNTIME_HEADER` from `scripts/dev/upstream_refresh.py`. Change header comments
  there as well; comments between entries are lost.
- The full pattern: `docs/runtime-package-pattern.md`.

## Memory

Never write, edit or delete memory files without explicit human approval.
Propose the entry and where it belongs first, then wait for the decision.

## Worktrees

- Sessions always start at the project root, never inside `.worktrees/`.
- One worktree per issue: `.worktrees/issue-<N>-<slug>/` on branch
  `feature/<N>-<slug>`. Remove it once its branch lands.
- The main worktree is read-only; every edit goes through a worktree.
- Read, Edit and Write use the worktree's absolute path. Bash commands `cd`
  into the worktree first or use absolute paths.
- The full convention: <https://github.com/vergil-project/vergil-tooling/blob/develop/docs/specs/worktree-convention.md>.
- Brief each parallel sub-agent with its [Agent prompt contract](https://github.com/vergil-project/vergil-tooling/blob/develop/docs/specs/worktree-convention.md#agent-prompt-contract).

## Git and GitHub

Use `vrg-git` and `vrg-gh` only; the hook guard blocks raw `git` and `gh`. If a
command is not available through the wrappers, explain why and ask the human to
run it with `! <command>` in the prompt.

## Validation

`vrg-container-run -- vrg-validate` is the only validation command. Don't run
linters, formatters or tests outside it; a tool it doesn't invoke is not part
of the pipeline.

## PR handoff

- Agents never run `vrg-submit-pr`. Submitting, merging and finalizing a PR are
  human actions.
- Hand off with `vrg-pr-workflow report-ready --issue <N> --title --summary
  --notes`. It pushes the branch itself. Leave `--linkage` at its default (`Ref`).
- A delta touching `.github/workflows/**` makes GitHub refuse the agent push.
  That is expected: report-ready records the state anyway and the human's
  `vrg-submit-pr` pushes the branch.
- After report-ready the branch is frozen: no new commits and no push that
  advances it; more work is a new follow-up issue. Re-running report-ready to
  fix the prose is allowed. `vrg-pr-workflow unfreeze` is the only way to lift it.
- The report-ready title, summary and notes are public (the relay ref is
  world-readable): never put secrets in them.

## Local settings

`.claude/settings.local.json` must stay absent or exactly `{}`; the agent tools
refuse otherwise. See the [ownership model](https://github.com/vergil-project/vergil-tooling/blob/develop/docs/site/docs/guides/claude-config-ownership.md).

## Engineering principles

- Correctness over cost over speed. Never ship known-broken code with a
  follow-up fix; if something is wrong, fix it now.
- No silent failures: no swallowed exceptions, no `except: return ""`, no
  fallbacks that hide errors. A failure hidden in code becomes a hallucination
  at the AI layer.
